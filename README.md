# Tiny Joypad Variant

This is an old project of mine based on Daniel C's Tiny Joypad schematic https://www.tinyjoypad.com. Formally on Hackaday.io.

I started this in 2018 and made some final updates in 2021. It's a tiny handheld games console that plays ATtiny85 games cartridges. Rotating screen to play both landscape and portrait games. It was my first 'proper" electronics projects, and I'd do it differently today for sure. It works though.

There aren't any build instructions apart from some old de-listed YouTube video's (links below). These have terrible sound quality.
